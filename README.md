# Carleton-University-WebScrapper
While exploring potential graduate security labs to join, I came across the <a href="https://security.scs.carleton.ca/people.html">CSL Lab</a> as one of the top contenders. However, a challenge arose when I needed to connect with each graduate student to gather firsthand experiences working in the lab. Many of the graduate students did not have their LinkedIn profiles linked on the <a href="https://security.scs.carleton.ca/people.html">CSL Lab's website</a>.

##Overview 
This project aims to streamline the process of gathering LinkedIn profiles of graduate students from the CSL Lab at Carleton University. By utilizing Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries in Python, this script navigates through the CSL Lab's webpage, extracts relevant information, and searches for corresponding LinkedIn profiles.

##Features 

-Automated browsing: The script automates the process of navigating through the CSL Lab's webpage to extract necessary data.
-LinkedIn profile search: Using extracted data, the script searches for corresponding LinkedIn profiles to gather additional information about graduate students.
-Scalability: The script is designed to handle a large number of profiles efficiently, making it suitable for future updates or modifications.

##Requirements
To run this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
*Python 3.x
*Selenium
*BeautifulSoup
