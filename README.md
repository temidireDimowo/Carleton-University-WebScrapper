During my research on the potential graduate security labs I could join. I identified the <a href="https://security.scs.carleton.ca/people.html">CSL Lab</a> as one of the top contenders. 
I needed to connect with each graduate student. I wanted to get their first hand experience working in the lab.
The problem with the labs website was that a majority of them did not have their linkedin profiles linked to their pages. 

I dawned on me that I would have to go through the duanting task of manually searching for their linkedin profiles. 

Then it dawned on me that I could build a python script to solve all my problems. 

I successfuly built my Python script with the help of Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
